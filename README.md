### CHALLENGE
 - Write a function - sumAndProduct() - that takes two positive integers, a sum and a product, and returns the smallest two positive integers x and y, where x + y == sum, and x * y == product.
 - Return x and y in an array with the smaller number first in the format [x, y]
 - If a solution cannot be found, return the empty array
 
 ```// Example: sumAndProduct(6, 9) should return [3, 3] because 3 + 3 == 6, and 3 * 3 == 9.```
